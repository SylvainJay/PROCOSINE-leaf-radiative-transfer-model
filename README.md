# procosine
The repository contains all the matlab codes needed to run the PROSPECT+COSINE leaf radiative transfer model in forward and inverse modes, as well as 5 reduced hyperspectral images (matlab format) of various leaves exhibiting different pigment contents and surface properties.

For more details about the model and data acquisition, see: S. Jay, R. Bendoula, X. Hadoux, J.-B. Féret, N. Gorretta: "A physically-based model for retrieving foliar biochemistry and leaf orientation using close-range imaging spectroscopy". Remote Sensing of Environment, 2016; 177: 220–236.
